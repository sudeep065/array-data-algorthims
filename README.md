## Simple-ArraySum
Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.
Complete the simpleArraySum function in the editor below. It must return the sum of the array elements as an integer.
Sample Input

6
1 2 3 4 10 11
Sample Output

31
Explanation
1+2+3+4+10+11 = 31

## Sum-Diagonals
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
Given in a List<List<int>> find the diagonal sum from Left to right and Right to Left.
Sample Input 
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Sample Output
0
Explanation
Sum everything from 1+5+9=15 and 3+5+7=15 (15-15)=0


## MinMaxSum
Simple MinMaxSum in given array.
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 
Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
Sample Input

1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

10 14
Explanation
Sum everything 1 except , the sum is =14.
Sum everything 2 except , the sum is =13.
Sum everything 3 except , the sum is =12.
Sum everything 4 except , the sum is =11.
Sum everything 5 except , the sum is =10.

## Tallest-Duplicates
Count how many candles are tallest in a given array which are repeated or duplicates.

Sample Input
3 2 1 3
Sample Output
2
Explanation
Candle heights are . The tallest candles are  units, and there are  of them.

## Plus-Minus
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. 
Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

Sample Input  
arr[] size n = 6
arr = [-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]

Sample Output
0.500000
0.333333
0.166667

Explanation
There are 3 positive numbers,  negative 2 numbers, and 1 zero in the array.
The proportions of occurrence are positive:3/6=0.500000 , negative:2/6=0.333333  and zeros: 1/6=0.166667.


## Staircase-Triangle
This is a staircase of size n:6
Sample Input
6 

Sample Output
     #
    ##
   ###
  ####
 #####
######

Explanation
The staircase is right-aligned, composed of # symbols and spaces, and has a height and width of .
     
## smallest-missing-no
array of size n
Sample Input
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

Sample Output
     6

Explanation
The binary search, find the middle index is in the right position, to decide whether missing element in left half or right half.
